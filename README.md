# Stanford Statistical Learning

Sample R code written during my taking of Stanford Lagunita Online's offering of Stastical Learning, available <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/info">here</a>. The course follows closely the sequence of chapters in the textbook "An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani - Springer 2013). This textbook is available for free online at http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ thanks to the authors.

I have enhanced most of the code with my personal comments, which would be of particular benefit to those taking an R-based statistical learning course for the first time.

This is the version of the course ended April 2016. Topics covered were as follows:</br> 

Week 1: Introduction and Overview of Statistical Learning</br> 
Week 2: Linear Regression</br> 
Week 3: Classification</br> 
Week 4: Resampling Methods</br>
Week 5: Linear Model Selection and Regularization</br> 
Week 6: Moving Beyond Linearity</br>
Week 7: Tree-based Methods</br> 
Week 8: Support Vector Machines</br>
Week 9: Unsupervised Learning</br>

# How to run

I would recommend downloading the <strong>R</strong> statistical language from https://cran.r-project.org/
After downloading <strong>R</strong>, download the IDE, called RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/
After downloading the correct files for your operating system, launch RStudio to utilise the code supplied. By the way, it's all open source software so it's free.
